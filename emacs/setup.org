brew install --cask emacs

git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d

ln -s ~/myconfig/spacemacs ~/.spacemacs
#+end_src

** Installing spacemacs on windows
   
** Setting up the .spacemacs file  :windows:
https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/16226/complete-guide-to-symbolic-links-symlinks-on-windows-or-linux/

You should use a hard link!


#+begin_src
git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs $home\AppData\Roaming\.emacs.d
#+end_src


Do the following from admin command line (Powershell doesn't work https://superuser.com/questions/1307360/how-do-you-create-a-new-symlink-in-windows-10-using-powershell-not-mklink-exe )
#+begin_src 
mklink C:\Users\PC\AppData\Roaming\.spacemacs C:\Users\PC\AppData\Roaming\myconfig\spacemacs
#+end_src


Soft links are as follows but we don't want that:
#+begin_src 
mklink /D Link Target
#+end_src
** Fixing a bug in projectile
If you get the following


 org-projectile/:config: Symbolâ€™s function definition is void: org-projectile:per-repo

https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/9374

#+begin_src 
find ~/.emacs.d/elpa -name "*elc" -delete
#+end_src
** SDKMAN on windows is more complicated.  :windows:
You need git bash which is probably already installed (to install spacemacs).
** Git auto pushing for mytracked files.

You need to register your email address in the git config if you haven't done so before.

#+begin_src 
PC@LAPTOP-74MHHK0F MINGW64 ~/mytrackedfiles (master)
$ git config --global user.name "dmg46664"

PC@LAPTOP-74MHHK0F MINGW64 ~/mytrackedfiles (master)
$ git config --global user.email "dmg46664@noreply.github.com"
#+end_src

(hangs at the end and have to click enter)

When you load emacs on Windows, you'll likely get too many pipes/files
error each time you load it as it installs the libraries.
Just keep closing it and opening it until it loads.

scoop install keepass

# Note: if you get an error you might need to change the execution policy (i.e. enable Powershell) with
# Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser
Invoke-Expression (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://get.scoop.sh')
