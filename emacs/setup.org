* Setting up Spacemacs
** Setting up the .spacemacs file  :windows:
https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/16226/complete-guide-to-symbolic-links-symlinks-on-windows-or-linux/

You should use a hard link!


TODO At some point move spacemacs to the emacs directory
#+begin_src 
mklink C:\Users\PC\AppData\Roaming\.spacemacs C:\Users\PC\AppData\Roaming\myconfig\spacemacs
#+end_src

Soft links are as follows but we don't want that:
#+begin_src 
mklink /D Link Target
#+end_src
** Fixing a bug in projectile
If you get the following


 org-projectile/:config: Symbolâ€™s function definition is void: org-projectile:per-repo

https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/9374

#+begin_src 
find ~/.emacs.d/elpa -name "*elc" -delete
#+end_src
** SDKMAN on windows is more complicated.  :windows:
You need git bash which is probably already installed (to install spacemacs).
** Git auto pushing for mytracked files.

You need to register your email address in the git config if you haven't done so before.

#+begin_src 
PC@LAPTOP-74MHHK0F MINGW64 ~/mytrackedfiles (master)
$ git config --global user.name "dmg46664"

PC@LAPTOP-74MHHK0F MINGW64 ~/mytrackedfiles (master)
$ git config --global user.email "dmg46664@noreply.github.com"
#+end_src
** Clojure tools

Installed with the -bypass (see lower down in the windows guide) option and chose
location 1.

Maybe try scoop
https://scoop.sh/

(Didn't have to install powershell or ndk
