You should use a hard link!


TODO At some point move spacemacs to the emacs directory
#+begin_src 
mklink C:\Users\PC\AppData\Roaming\.spacemacs C:\Users\PC\AppData\Roaming\myconfig\spacemacs
#+end_src


Soft links are as follows but we don't want that:
#+begin_src 
mklink /D Link Target
#+end_src

#+begin_src

$ git config --global user.name "dmg46664"

$ git config --global user.email "dmg46664@noreply.github.com"
