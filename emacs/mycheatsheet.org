In a cell, do C-c ? for a reference of table functions.

#+begin_src 
But what we really want is to compute the formulas for all fields in the column named "Mean". 
In other words, we really want a column formula, not a field formula.

To replace the formula with a column formula, go back to the field where it has been defined and type =vmean($2..$3). 
Note that the only difference with what you've inserted previously is that the formula is prefixed by = instead of :=. 
When you're done, do a C-c C-c in the field: you should be prompted whether you want to 
replace the formula with a column formula, which is precisely what we want.

Once you agree with this, the value in the field should be the same than before (namely 11) and you can now update 
all the fields in this column by reapplying all formulas with C-u C-c * (or C-c C-c if you're on the #+TBLFM line.)
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
Interactively edit formulas
------------------------------------------------
For now we have been defining formulas by inserting them directly in the table cells: typing = in a field 
starts the definition for a column formula and typing := starts a definition for a field formula.

If you prefer, you can edit formulas in the minibuffer: use C-c = for 
editing column formulas or C-u C-c = for field formulas.

But you can also edit formulas more interactively in a dedicated buffer by typing C-c '. 
This new buffer lists all the formulas for the table at point and provides facilities to edit the references.

When the cursor is above a reference, the corresponding field in the table get highlighted. Nice! 
But you can do more than that: you can actually select the reference by using the S-<left/right/up/down> keys.

* Notes
** helm-occur is the default edit window that comes with helm.
** TODO helm-swoop is an advanced mode version that hasn't been committed to in a while.
Outstanding issue: https://github.com/ShingoFukuyama/helm-swoop/issues/133
Also helm-swoop-caret-match seems to be blocking our ability to match new line characters
** helm-ag is yet another version that is built with grep. https://github.com/syohex/emacs-helm-ag

** Agenda refreshing 
* BUGS
** helm-ag doesn't work in spacemacs https://github.com/bbatsov/helm-projectile/issues/113
Might simply be that the `ag` command is not on the command prompt.
